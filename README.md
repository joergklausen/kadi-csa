# kadi-csa
The KADI (Knowledge and climate services from an African observation and Data research Infrastructure) Coordination and Support Action is a Horizon Europe project to advance the foundations for a pan-African research infrastructure for atmospheric and climate services. KADI is coordinated by [ICOS](https://www.icos-cp.eu) and builds - inter alia - on the results of an earlier project, [SEACRIFOG](https://www.seacrifog.eu/).

This repo mainly serves the partnership between Kenya Meteorological Department KMD and the Swiss project partners MeteoSwiss, Empa and Agroscope.
